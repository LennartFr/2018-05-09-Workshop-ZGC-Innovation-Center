# Designing and creating Blockchain applications

## Step 1: Learn Design Thinking

[IBM Design Thinking Field Guide](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/12/ibm-design-thinking-field-guide/)

## Step 2: Go through IBM Blockchain Use Cases

[IBM Blockchain Use Cases](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/use-cases/)

## Step 3a: Take the IBM Blockchain on-line course

[Zero to Blockchain An IBM Redbooks course](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/Redbooks.nsf/RedbookAbstracts/crse0401.html)

## Step 3b: Go through selected Blockchain Developer Patterns
[Blockchain Developer Patterns](https://developer.ibm.com/code/technologies/blockchain/)

## Step 4: Learn the Hyperledger Composer tool
[Hyperledger Composer Tutorial](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/next/)

[Writing Your First Application](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/write_first_app.html?highlight=fabcar)

In Hyperledger Composer: save data model as a .bna file.

## Step 5: Deploy the business network to Hyperledger Fabric. 
* This requires the Hyperledger Composer chaincode to be installed on the peer,
* then the business network archive (.bna) must be sent to the peer, 
* and a new participant, identity, and associated card must be created to be the network administrator. 
* Finally, the network administrator business network card must be imported for use, 
* and the network can then be pinged to check it is responding.
